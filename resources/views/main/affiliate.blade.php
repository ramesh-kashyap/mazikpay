Referral income is pooled instantly. You do not need to have an active deposit in your account to be eligible to get referral income. The referral income will be credited directly to the E-wallet upon the completion of the registration and Services.</p>
                                        <p>Binary matching income is 10% of the matching left and right side business volume. The matching business volume on both sides is flushed out after matching. It is mandatory to have active deposits to be qualified for binary matching bonus. Binary matching bonus is calculated every 24 hours. Power leg is carried forward. Down-lines do not have to be your direct referrals; they can be referred by anyone and still their Servicess will be counted under your binary value.</p>
                                        <p>In binary matching plan, the new clients are placed below the introducer (sponsor/referrer) to the left or right sub-tree. The tree of a binary network plan will have two legs-left and right; but if a member recruits more than two, then the additional member will be added to the next member down-line. This concept allows the additional member to be shared with the down-line member (power leg) and the one who recruited them. This is referred to as spill-over. With respect to the profit leg (weaker leg), there will not be a spill-over as the profit leg will be expanded with individually sponsored down-lines. The binary plan is mostly quantity oriented and not based on the levels.</p>
                                        <p>Example: Consider that there is $1200 under your right side and $300 under your left side. The $300 on your right side and $300 on your left side is matched and flushed off, and you will be paid $30 binary matching income, i.e., 10% of the matching value. Remaining $900 on your right side will be carried forward for next matching. </p>
